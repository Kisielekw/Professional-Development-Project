Next you will want to open unity hub, go into projects and select add. Find the place where you have cloned the project and select it. After this unity hub will identify which version of unity the prototype was created on. Download the appropriate version and open the project. 

After Doing some work on the project close unity and keep open visual studio. Write an appropriate commit name and push to main.
